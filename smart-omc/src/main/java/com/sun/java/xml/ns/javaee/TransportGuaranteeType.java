/**
 * 
 * 
 * 	The transport-guaranteeType specifies that the communication
 * 	between client and server should be NONE, INTEGRAL, or
 * 	CONFIDENTIAL. NONE means that the application does not
 * 	require any transport guarantees. A value of INTEGRAL means
 * 	that the application requires that the data sent between the
 * 	client and server be sent in such a way that it can't be
 * 	changed in transit. CONFIDENTIAL means that the application
 * 	requires that the data be transmitted in a fashion that
 * 	prevents other entities from observing the contents of the
 * 	transmission. In most cases, the presence of the INTEGRAL or
 * 	CONFIDENTIAL flag will indicate that the use of SSL is
 * 	required.
 * 
 * 	Used in: user-data-constraint
